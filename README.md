## Hey guys, did you know that...
...in terms of programming languages, `vappy` is the coolest?

## What is it?
`vappy` is a programming language that's based off of the infamous [Vaporeon copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/eidplc/vaporeon_copypasta/).
Every program must start with the phrase `Hey guys, did you know that...`, and
end with `Vaporeon is literally built for human dick.` Other typical programming
constructs are based on phrases taken from the copypasta.

The language is incredibly verbose, unnecessarily complicated, and very NSFW.

Here's a sample Hello World program - a "Hey Guys" program, if you will:
```
Hey guys, did you know that...
    There's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would say "Hey guys, did you know that...".
Vaporeon is literally built for human dick.
```

For more information, see the [spec](spec.md).

### Getting Started
Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a sample program:
```
python -m main examples/hey_guys.vp
```

Print the first 20 Fibonacci numbers:
```
python -m main examples/fib.vp
```

### Note
This was created for the [Stupid Shit That No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](https://stupidhackathon.com/).
As such, it's very much in a hackathon-demo state.
Some things don't work perfectly, and debugging is nearly impossible.
Additionally, the language isn't as grammatically correct as I'd like.
I might polish it up a bit at some point, but if you've got ideas or bugfixes, 
feel free to submit a PR!
